<h2 id="section-1">Nozzles</h2>
<h6 ><em>What is a nozzle ?</em></h6>
<p style="background-color:tomato;padding:15px 20px;">
   Diesel injector nozzles are spring-loaded closed valves that spray fuel directly into the combustion chamber or precombustion chamber when the injector is opened.
   Injector nozzles are threaded or clamped into the cylinder head, one for each cylinder, and are replaceable as an assembly.
</p>
<p>
   Design of the diesel fuel injector nozzle is critical to the performance and emissions of modern diesel engines. 
   Some of the important injector nozzle design parameters include details of the injector seat, the injector sac and nozzle hole size and shape. 
   These features not only affect the combustion characteristics of the diesel engine, 
   they can also affect the stability of the emissions and performance over the lifetime of the engine and the mechanical durability of the injector.</p>
<p>
  All nozzles must produce a fuel spray that meets the requirements of the performance and emissions goals of the market for which the engine is produced regardless of details of the fuel system design (i.e.,
  regardless if the fuel system is of the common rail, unit injector, unit pump or pump-line-nozzle type). Additionally,
  specific requirements for injection nozzles can also depend on the fuel system type [Potz 2000]:<br/>
 <strong>Common rail—nozzle</strong>  operates under more demanding tribological conditions and must be better designed to prevent leakage.<br/>
  <strong>Unit injector/unit pump—pressure pulsing conditions</strong> create more demanding fatigue strength requirements.
</p>                 	                 
<h3>Are Gas and Fuel nozzles the same?</h3>
  <p>  Because diesel nozzles are larger than gasoline nozzles, they will not fit in your gasoline vehicle’s tank.
     The tiny gasoline nozzle will readily fit into diesel filler necks, thus diesel drivers should exercise particular caution.</p>
    
<h3>Is a Diesel nozzle Bigger?</h3>
<p> Because the diesel pump nozzle is larger than most petrol filler necks, it will not fit. As a result,
   putting the wrong fuel in a petrol car is significantly less common than putting petrol in a diesel engine.</p>
<p>Plus, putting diesel in a petrol engine isn’t as dangerous as it is for a diesel engine, so there’s normally less damage.
It’s a huge annoyance. However, it isn’t as serious as the harm that gasoline may do to a diesel engine. Once the fuel has been emptied away, your petrol engine should not be permanently damaged.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Fuel Pumps</h2>
<h6>what is a pump ?</h6>
<p style="background-color:tomato;padding:15px 20px;"> A fuel pump is a component used in many liquid-fuelled engines (such as petrol/gasoline or diesel engines) to transfer the fuel from the fuel tank to the device where it is mixed with the intake air (such as the carburetor or fuel injector).</p>
<h4>Types of Fuel Pumps</h4>
<ol>
<li>	<h3>Common rail fuel injection pump. </h3><p>An electronically controlled diesel fuel supply system, this pump was developed to meet the strict 21st century exhaust gas regulations. It consists of a supply pump, common rail, electronically controlled injectors,
   a variety of sensors to detect the engine’s running condition, and a computer that controls all of these devices.
   The engine drives the supply pump, which produces high-pressure fuel. The common rail distributes the fuel to the injectors, which are mounted on each cylinder of the engine.</p></li>
<li><h3>Distributor (rotary) fuel injection pump.</h3> <p>This diesel fuel pump is also controlled electronically by various sensors, an electronic control unit, and an actuator. Similar to the common rail pump, the sensors detect the engine’s running condition and send signals to the control unit.
   The actuator controls how much fuel is injected and its timing according to the signals it receives from the control unit. The control unit determines what signals it sends by calculating the optimum levels for the engine’s running condition</p>.</li>
<li><h3>In-line fuel injection pump.</h3> <p>One of two mechanically controlled diesel fuel systems, the in-line fuel injection pump matches the engine cylinders in their number of fuel pressure mechanisms. This pump is primarily used for medium to large trucks and construction machinery. 
  A camshaft drives the fuel pressure and injection quantity control mechanisms within the pump body. The elements in that body follow an injection order to feed fuel to each engine cylinder.</p></li>
<li><h3>Distributor injection pump. </h3><p>Also a mechanically controlled diesel fuel pump, the distributor injection pump has just one fuel pressure mechanism, despite the number of engine cylinders the vehicle may have. 
  The distributor is designed to follow the injection order to distribute pressurized fuel to each cylinder. The pump housing holds all of its components, including the governor, timer, and feed pump. As it is so compact, this pump is light and can operate at high speeds, making it perfect for small engines.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4>Available Pumps.</h4>
<p>Pumps are all available in all forms and types,shop at your own level of the pocket.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">fuel injectors</h2>   
<p style="background-color:tomato;padding:15px 20px;"> Fuel injectors are the main players in this system. These pieces make sure that the engine is receiving the perfect amount of fuel in that moment. The injectors deliver the fuel as a fine mist into the cylinders. 
  The complexities and variations of this part vary between engine models.</p>
